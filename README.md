## Discription
This repository contains my project for the 'SER421: Web-based Programming Client API Access Lab'. 
The primary objective of this lab is to develop a client-side application that interacts with a remote API. 
The project specifically focuses on creating a web-based version of the popular game show Jeopardy!, utilizing Vue.js (Version 3 with the Options API).

## Key Features
- Jeopardy! Game Implementation: A web-based trivia game modeled after the TV show Jeopardy!, featuring three players and a game board with 4 categories and 5 questions per category.
- Dynamic API Interaction: Utilizes the Open Trivia Database API for fetching trivia questions in different categories and difficulty levels.
- Game Mechanics: Includes features like true/false trivia questions, score tracking, and player turns, with modifications to the standard gameplay for practicality.
- Double Jeopardy Enhancement: Implements the Double Jeopardy feature, allowing players to wager on questions under specific conditions.

## Technologies Used:
- Vue.js (Version 3, Options API)
- HTML, CSS for UI design
- JavaScript for client-side logic

## Constraints
- Developed exclusively in Vue.js without external libraries.
- Adheres to the guidelines and specifications provided in the course.
